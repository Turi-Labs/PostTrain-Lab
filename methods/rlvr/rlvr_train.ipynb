        "This notebook demonstrates RLVR training on the MBPP dataset. Unlike SFT which learns from correct examples, RLVR allows the model to explore different solutions and learn from automated test execution feedback.\n",

        "- Sample multiple solutions from the model\n",
        "- Execute code against test cases to get verifiable rewards\n",
        "- Use policy gradient methods (PPO) to reinforce successful solutions\n",
        "- Learn from both successes and failures\n"
