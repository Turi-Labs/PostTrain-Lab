🧠 PostTrain-Lab

A unified playground for post-training large language models.

PostTrain-Lab is a modular educational project designed to explore post-training methods for LLMs, from supervised fine-tuning to 
reinforcement learning and beyond.

It provides a consistent interface to experiment with different techniques, evaluate results, and compare outcomes across settings.
